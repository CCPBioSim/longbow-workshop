To do this, if you look either in the Longbow logfile or in the verbose output in your terminal, you will see the name of your recovery file printed out. Copy the name of this file and use it like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "This functionality is quite handy when running long, or many simulations so that you can grab a daily update or to check the progress of simulations for the first hour or so before leaving them over a long period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also on ARCHER there is a 16 simulation cap, this means that you can only have 16 simulations in the queue at any one time. Longbow will let you submit unlimited amounts of simulations but will batch these into the first 16 and withold the rest. By running an update, any simulations finishing will free up a slot, Longbow will then submit some of the remaining simulations to take their place by doing an update."
